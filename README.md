# Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
This project fine-tunes the BERT (bert-base-uncased) model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the CoNLL-2003 dataset. It identifies entities like persons, locations, and organizations in text. The project evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, ensuring its effectiveness for real-world NLU tasks.
